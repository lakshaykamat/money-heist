            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Lisbon began as the enemy. In the first heist,
                she was
                constantly trying to thwart The Professor, and she was smart enough to almost pull it off before he
                started courting her to distract her. Then a strange thing happened — they fell in love. Her police
                partner didn't like their relationship from the get-go, but since she finds Sergio Marquina (aka The
                Professor) to be the more interesting and compassionate man, she chooses him.

                After Raquel finds out who Sergio is, she's obviously hurt. But eventually, their mutual respect and
                affection — combined with her growing hatred for the system she was supposed to be protecting — leads
                her to run off and join him. In the second heist, she's part of the group under the name Lisbon, every
                bit as hardcore and awesome as they are but also armed with greater intelligence about the other side
                and working as The Professor's partner in brains and love. Even Tokyo, who obviously hates former
                authority figures who interrogated her, eventually warms up to Lisbon. She would be higher on the list
                if we didn't dislike her so much during the first heist for trying to trap The Professor and his crew.

        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Mirko Dragic In the first heist, Helsinki is
                the hired
                muscle along with his brother (by experience, not blood — they're really cousins) Oslo. At first a
                stone-faced golem, Helsinki shows himself to be eternally loyal, strong, and a good person, which makes
                him the member we most want to know. And the scene when he has to "kill" the braindead Oslo may be the
                first time you cry watching the series.

                After the first heist, Helsinki is partnered up with Nairobi, and they have a ton of fun as lost people
                partying and playing a married couple. She develops a love for him despite the fact that he's gay, and
                while he doesn't return the romantic feeling, she becomes family. While they plan round two, he falls in
                with Palermo, who doesn't reciprocate his mental affections, though he's all about the physical.
                Eventually, Helsinki breaks through his iron shell.

                The first to take up whatever tough job needs to be done, Helsinki is the member of the crew with the
                purest heart and the most courage. His love of Nairobi inspires all of us to care for those closest to
                us, and he even inspires Palermo to finally care about somebody for the first time since Berlin.</p>

        <img src="/docs/Images/Monica.webp" class="w-auto m-auto h-auto img-animate my-2" alt="">
        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">We first meet Mónica Gaztambide as a put-upon
                underling
                working at the Spanish Mint. She is Arturo's mistress, and when he finds out she's pregnant, he ends
                things with her. Then, they get taken over by The Professor's crew, and Arturo pressures the hostages to
                help him be a hero. Mónica does so, and Berlin tells Denver to kill her, but he can't do it. Instead,
                Denver shoots her in the leg so that Berlin thinks he's done the deed, and then he rehabs her. Slowly,
                they fall in love, though people say it's because she has "Stockholm syndrome," which is the eventual
                codename she takes.

                Eventually, Mónica chooses to be with Denver, and she becomes part of the crew by the end of the 2nd
                season after picking up a gun to help the crew escape. When round two begins, she immediately jumps into
                the mix, but she doesn't have the mental toughness of the former robbers. She's scared, in part for her
                child. After Arturo tries to kill Denver and the rest of the crew, she shoots him, which should be a
                moment of triumph over the man who had belittled her. Instead, she feels like she jeopardized her backup
                plan: having Arturo raise their biological child. Season 5 ends with her messed up on drugs she's taken
                to numb herself, rendering her useless during the crew's biggest firefight of the whole series.

    <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
        <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Anibal Cortes is the baby of the heist crew.
            He's constantly seen as the weakest link, both in the first heist when the authorities get his parents
            to plead with him and in the second when he proves as much. In particular, when Gandia escapes, Rio has
            a chance to shoot him but can't bring himself to do so. Anybody else in the group would've taken the
            supercop out, and Gandia's escape ultimately leads to Nairobi's death, putting blood on Rio's hands.

            Rio is also one of Tokyo's main weaknesses — she cares about him, and that leads her to make decisions
            that jeopardize the rest of the crew. He freaks out when she is given up in the first heist but is
            easily overpowered. And while he seems nice enough and has lots of tech knowledge, he can be kind of
            boring. Plus, Rio is a bit more of a passive actor than an active one. More specifically, he joined the
            heist because he didn't have many other options, and in the second plot, he's revealed to be even less
            tough after his time in captivity. It'll be interesting to see if he steps up now that Tokyo is gone,
            but so far, he's still the weakest link.
