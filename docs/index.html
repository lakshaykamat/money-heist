            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Immortalised by Alvaro Morte, ‘The Professor’
                is the chief architect behind the various nerve-wracking action sequences in the show. Money Heist would
                not have been the same had this mastermind not been there. He turns a group of simple rogues into a
                delectable unit who, despite their crimes of looting the Bank of Spain, manage to secure the best spot
                in the hearts of the audience who root for them. A master of manipulation and deceit, he is the main
                driving force who operates from the wings. Intelligent, meticulous and ambitious, the Professor is well
                versed in almost everything, including politics, negotiations, heists, psychology and more. He is calm
                and possesses innate leadership qualities. He has the ability to infuse motivation into this team at
                their lowest. When asked what he liked about his character, Morte said, “I like many things about The
                Professor but mainly his patience and capacity to work. He’s an intelligent guy. He’s spent years just
                working on a plan”. He was also awestruck by how the Professor never waited for “inspiration” to make
                things work. According to Morte, the Professor’s immense “hard work” is what makes him so very likeable.
                We totally agree!</p>

        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Smart, volatile and unpredictable, Tokyo is
                the
                first character the audience is introduced to and serves as the ubiquitous narrator of the show. With a
                tempestuous temperament, Tokyo is spirited, reckless and wild. Undeniably brave, Tokyo has had her fair
                share of questionable moments on the show and often annoyed the audience with her impulsive nature. She
                has
                a complicated relationship with Rio and a wonderful bond with Nairobi. With a tragic past, Tokyo is
                fiercely
                protective and very caring.
                . Played by Ursula Corbero, the character is given a different dimension by the actress who humanises
                her.
                The Professor’s absolute favourite, despite her stubbornness, Tokyo is a pivotal character in the show.
                Tokyo’s death was one of the boldest moves by the showrunners who killed off the most popular character
                on
                the show. She sacrificed herself to save the team and to prevent the Army from taking over the Bank of
                Spain. </p>

        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Alex Pina has initially not written Nairobi’s
                character. Including her to make the gang more balanced was perhaps one of his best decisions as Nairobi
                turned out to be an absolute fan favourite. Nairobi is an expert at forging and counterfeiting. With a
                tragic backstory, where she lost the custody of her son due to her prison time, she is a true leader who
                never backs down from challenging the patriarchal dominance in the team. She is sympathetic and bold as
                well
                as extremely lively and intriguing, making her one of the most well-rounded characters on the show.
                Agata
                Jimenez’s Nairobi went on to become one of the most beloved and amicable characters on the show whose
                death
                was a central cause of conflict in the show as well as among fans who were shocked to see their
                favourite
                character being killed in cold blood. The Professor and his gang wanted to honour her and seek
                vengeance,
                regrouping by chanting “For Nairobi” in the finale. She is the symbol of undefeated matriarchy in the
                film
                and someone we miss dearly!</p>

    <!-- Berlin-->
    <div class="sm:m-12">

        <img src="/Images/Berlin.jpg" class="w-auto m-auto h-auto img-animate my-2" alt="">
        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Although Pedro Alonso’s Berlin was a pretty
                complicated, cold and calculative character, in the beginning, he was the Professor’s brother-in-arms
                and
                second-in-command. With sharp observational skills, Berlin shields the chaos in his heart with a stoic
                demeanour. Alonso had reportedly derived inspiration for this character from a previous interaction with
                a
                person who was a slightly manipulative provocateur. Although the Professor and Berlin were not
                originally
                supposed to have such a close bond, the actors insisted on it and that worked in the favour of the
                series.
                Alonso’s brilliant portrayal of this arrogant yet suave and enigmatic character even won him the ‘Best
                Supporting Television Actor’ award in 2018. While audience members generally loathed Berlin in the
                beginning
                due to his difficult and nonchalant demeanour, his selflessness in the face of death left them in tears.
                In
                the second season, the terminally ill Berlin sacrifices himself to help the rest of the gang escape
                unhurt
                while he receives the brunt of the police fire.

        <img src="/Images/Denver.jpg" class="w-auto m-auto h-auto img-animate my-2" alt="">
        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Jaime Lorente’s Denver is one of the most
                endearing
                characters on the show. He is born into a life of crime and joins his father on this heist to escape a
                low-paying mining job. Although he is temperamental in the beginning, he displays a human and
                sympathetic
                side when he defies Berlin’s orders to keep a hostage named Monica safe with whom he later falls in
                love,
                adding plenty of heartwarming romantic moments to the show. Goofy and lion-hearted, Denver, however, has
                a
                bizarre, signature laugh that was improvised by Lorente. According to Lorente, the actor had to work
                hard to
                develop this “trashy laugh” for the character. He first stumbled upon him while auditioning for the
                show.
                “From the very beginning, they wanted Denver to have a unique and significant laugh,” he said. “And what
                happened is that I kept trying different ones, I found this one and we settled on it. And that was
                probably
                the main reason I was selected for this role.”</p>

        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Lisbon began as the enemy. In the first heist,
                she was
                constantly trying to thwart The Professor, and she was smart enough to almost pull it off before he
                started courting her to distract her. Then a strange thing happened — they fell in love. Her police
                partner didn't like their relationship from the get-go, but since she finds Sergio Marquina (aka The
                Professor) to be the more interesting and compassionate man, she chooses him.

                After Raquel finds out who Sergio is, she's obviously hurt. But eventually, their mutual respect and
                affection — combined with her growing hatred for the system she was supposed to be protecting — leads
                her to run off and join him. In the second heist, she's part of the group under the name Lisbon, every
                bit as hardcore and awesome as they are but also armed with greater intelligence about the other side
                and working as The Professor's partner in brains and love. Even Tokyo, who obviously hates former
                authority figures who interrogated her, eventually warms up to Lisbon. She would be higher on the list
                if we didn't dislike her so much during the first heist for trying to trap The Professor and his crew.

    <!-- Helsinki-->

        <img src="/Images/Helsinki.webp" class="w-auto m-auto h-auto img-animate my-2" alt="">
        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Mirko Dragic In the first heist, Helsinki is
                the hired
                muscle along with his brother (by experience, not blood — they're really cousins) Oslo. At first a
                stone-faced golem, Helsinki shows himself to be eternally loyal, strong, and a good person, which makes
                him the member we most want to know. And the scene when he has to "kill" the braindead Oslo may be the
                first time you cry watching the series.

                After the first heist, Helsinki is partnered up with Nairobi, and they have a ton of fun as lost people
                partying and playing a married couple. She develops a love for him despite the fact that he's gay, and
                while he doesn't return the romantic feeling, she becomes family. While they plan round two, he falls in
                with Palermo, who doesn't reciprocate his mental affections, though he's all about the physical.
                Eventually, Helsinki breaks through his iron shell.

                The first to take up whatever tough job needs to be done, Helsinki is the member of the crew with the
                purest heart and the most courage. His love of Nairobi inspires all of us to care for those closest to
                us, and he even inspires Palermo to finally care about somebody for the first time since Berlin.</p>

        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-3">
            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">We first meet Mónica Gaztambide as a put-upon
                underling
                working at the Spanish Mint. She is Arturo's mistress, and when he finds out she's pregnant, he ends
                things with her. Then, they get taken over by The Professor's crew, and Arturo pressures the hostages to
                help him be a hero. Mónica does so, and Berlin tells Denver to kill her, but he can't do it. Instead,
                Denver shoots her in the leg so that Berlin thinks he's done the deed, and then he rehabs her. Slowly,
                they fall in love, though people say it's because she has "Stockholm syndrome," which is the eventual
                codename she takes.

                Eventually, Mónica chooses to be with Denver, and she becomes part of the crew by the end of the 2nd
                season after picking up a gun to help the crew escape. When round two begins, she immediately jumps into
                the mix, but she doesn't have the mental toughness of the former robbers. She's scared, in part for her
                child. After Arturo tries to kill Denver and the rest of the crew, she shoots him, which should be a
                moment of triumph over the man who had belittled her. Instead, she feels like she jeopardized her backup
                plan: having Arturo raise their biological child. Season 5 ends with her messed up on drugs she's taken
                to numb herself, rendering her useless during the crew's biggest firefight of the whole series.

            <p class="leading-9 md:leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Anibal Cortes is the baby of the heist crew.
                He's constantly seen as the weakest link, both in the first heist when the authorities get his parents
                to plead with him and in the second when he proves as much. In particular, when Gandia escapes, Rio has
                a chance to shoot him but can't bring himself to do so. Anybody else in the group would've taken the
                supercop out, and Gandia's escape ultimately leads to Nairobi's death, putting blood on Rio's hands.

                Rio is also one of Tokyo's main weaknesses — she cares about him, and that leads her to make decisions
                that jeopardize the rest of the crew. He freaks out when she is given up in the first heist but is
                easily overpowered. And while he seems nice enough and has lots of tech knowledge, he can be kind of
                boring. Plus, Rio is a bit more of a passive actor than an active one. More specifically, he joined the
                heist because he didn't have many other options, and in the second plot, he's revealed to be even less
                tough after his time in captivity. It'll be interesting to see if he steps up now that Tokyo is gone,
                but so far, he's still the weakest link.
