            <p class="leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Immortalised by Alvaro Morte, ‘The Professor’
                is the chief architect behind the various nerve-wracking action sequences in the show. Money Heist would
                not have been the same had this mastermind not been there. He turns a group of simple rogues into a
                delectable unit who, despite their crimes of looting the Bank of Spain, manage to secure the best spot
                in the hearts of the audience who root for them. A master of manipulation and deceit, he is the main
                driving force who operates from the wings. Intelligent, meticulous and ambitious, the Professor is well
                versed in almost everything, including politics, negotiations, heists, psychology and more. He is calm
                and possesses innate leadership qualities. He has the ability to infuse motivation into this team at
                their lowest. When asked what he liked about his character, Morte said, “I like many things about The
                Professor but mainly his patience and capacity to work. He’s an intelligent guy. He’s spent years just
                working on a plan”. He was also awestruck by how the Professor never waited for “inspiration” to make
                things work. According to Morte, the Professor’s immense “hard work” is what makes him so very likeable.
                We totally agree!</p>

        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-5">
            <p class="leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Smart, volatile and unpredictable, Tokyo is the
                first character the audience is introduced to and serves as the ubiquitous narrator of the show. With a
                tempestuous temperament, Tokyo is spirited, reckless and wild. Undeniably brave, Tokyo has had her fair
                share of questionable moments on the show and often annoyed the audience with her impulsive nature. She
                has
                a complicated relationship with Rio and a wonderful bond with Nairobi. With a tragic past, Tokyo is
                fiercely
                protective and very caring.
                . Played by Ursula Corbero, the character is given a different dimension by the actress who humanises
                her.
                The Professor’s absolute favourite, despite her stubbornness, Tokyo is a pivotal character in the show.
                Tokyo’s death was one of the boldest moves by the showrunners who killed off the most popular character
                on
                the show. She sacrificed herself to save the team and to prevent the Army from taking over the Bank of
                Spain. </p>

            <p class="leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Alex Pina has initially not written Nairobi’s
                character. Including her to make the gang more balanced was perhaps one of his best decisions as Nairobi
                turned out to be an absolute fan favourite. Nairobi is an expert at forging and counterfeiting. With a
                tragic backstory, where she lost the custody of her son due to her prison time, she is a true leader who
                never backs down from challenging the patriarchal dominance in the team. She is sympathetic and bold as
                well
                as extremely lively and intriguing, making her one of the most well-rounded characters on the show.
                Agata
                Jimenez’s Nairobi went on to become one of the most beloved and amicable characters on the show whose
                death
                was a central cause of conflict in the show as well as among fans who were shocked to see their
                favourite
                character being killed in cold blood. The Professor and his gang wanted to honour her and seek
                vengeance,
                regrouping by chanting “For Nairobi” in the finale. She is the symbol of undefeated matriarchy in the
                film
                and someone we miss dearly!</p>

    <!-- Berlin-->

            class="w-auto m-auto h-auto img-animate" alt="">
        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-5">
            <p class="leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Although Pedro Alonso’s Berlin was a pretty
                complicated, cold and calculative character, in the beginning, he was the Professor’s brother-in-arms
                and
                second-in-command. With sharp observational skills, Berlin shields the chaos in his heart with a stoic
                demeanour. Alonso had reportedly derived inspiration for this character from a previous interaction with
                a
                person who was a slightly manipulative provocateur. Although the Professor and Berlin were not
                originally
                supposed to have such a close bond, the actors insisted on it and that worked in the favour of the
                series.
                Alonso’s brilliant portrayal of this arrogant yet suave and enigmatic character even won him the ‘Best
                Supporting Television Actor’ award in 2018. While audience members generally loathed Berlin in the
                beginning
                due to his difficult and nonchalant demeanour, his selflessness in the face of death left them in tears.
                In
                the second season, the terminally ill Berlin sacrifices himself to help the rest of the gang escape
                unhurt
                while he receives the brunt of the police fire.

        <div class="lg:mx-32 mx-5">
            <p class="leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Jaime Lorente’s Denver is one of the most
                endearing
                characters on the show. He is born into a life of crime and joins his father on this heist to escape a
                low-paying mining job. Although he is temperamental in the beginning, he displays a human and
                sympathetic
                side when he defies Berlin’s orders to keep a hostage named Monica safe with whom he later falls in
                love,
                adding plenty of heartwarming romantic moments to the show. Goofy and lion-hearted, Denver, however, has
                a
                bizarre, signature laugh that was improvised by Lorente. According to Lorente, the actor had to work
                hard to
                develop this “trashy laugh” for the character. He first stumbled upon him while auditioning for the
                show.
                “From the very beginning, they wanted Denver to have a unique and significant laugh,” he said. “And what
                happened is that I kept trying different ones, I found this one and we settled on it. And that was
                probably
                the main reason I was selected for this role.”</p>

            <p class="leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Raquel(Lisbon) began as the enemy. In the first heist, she was constantly trying to thwart The Professor, and she was smart enough to almost pull it off before he started courting her to distract her. Then a strange thing happened — they fell in love. Her police partner didn't like their relationship from the get-go, but since she finds Sergio Marquina (aka The Professor) to be the more interesting and compassionate man, she chooses him.

                After Raquel finds out who Sergio is, she's obviously hurt. But eventually, their mutual respect and affection — combined with her growing hatred for the system she was supposed to be protecting — leads her to run off and join him. In the second heist, she's part of the group under the name Lisbon, every bit as hardcore and awesome as they are but also armed with greater intelligence about the other side and working as The Professor's partner in brains and love. Even Tokyo, who obviously hates former authority figures who interrogated her, eventually warms up to Lisbon. She would be higher on the list if we didn't dislike her so much during the first heist for trying to trap The Professor and his crew.

            <p class="leading-10 tracking-wide para-animate">Mirko Dragic In the first heist, Helsinki is the hired muscle along with his brother (by experience, not blood — they're really cousins) Oslo. At first a stone-faced golem, Helsinki shows himself to be eternally loyal, strong, and a good person, which makes him the member we most want to know. And the scene when he has to "kill" the braindead Oslo may be the first time you cry watching the series.

                After the first heist, Helsinki is partnered up with Nairobi, and they have a ton of fun as lost people partying and playing a married couple. She develops a love for him despite the fact that he's gay, and while he doesn't return the romantic feeling, she becomes family. While they plan round two, he falls in with Palermo, who doesn't reciprocate his mental affections, though he's all about the physical. Eventually, Helsinki breaks through his iron shell.
                
                The first to take up whatever tough job needs to be done, Helsinki is the member of the crew with the purest heart and the most courage. His love of Nairobi inspires all of us to care for those closest to us, and he even inspires Palermo to finally care about somebody for the first time since Berlin.</p>
